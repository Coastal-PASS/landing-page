About Coastal PASS

A Legacy Rooted in Farming

Since 1971, Coastal Tractor has been a cornerstone of California’s Central Coast agricultural community.  Our parent company started as a small dealership run by a family of vegetable growers and has stayed family‑owned across three generations ￼.  Over the decades we’ve earned a reputation for fairness and integrity, treating every customer—from first‑time equipment buyers to long‑time friends—with respect ￼.  With locations in Salinas, King City and Paso Robles ￼, farmers know they can count on us for top‑quality machinery, knowledgeable advice and support whenever they need it.

Precision Technology With Family Values

Coastal PASS is the high‑tech division of Coastal Tractor.  We draw on more than 50 years of agricultural know‑how to develop digital tools that help you farm smarter.  Our team is made up of farmers, engineers and ag‑tech specialists who understand the unique challenges of vineyard and specialty‑crop production.  Like our colleagues at Coastal Tractor, we still pick up the phone, remember your name and go the extra mile to get you running again, but we also build and support precision systems that unlock new levels of efficiency.

Why We Exist
	•	Trusted expertise.  Coastal Tractor built its business by matching growers with the best equipment and servicing what we sell.  Coastal PASS extends that expertise into precision agriculture, offering fleet telematics, water‑management solutions, precision seeding, and application control to maximise yields and reduce waste.
	•	Industry‑leading partnerships.  As an authorised dealer for New Holland, we’ve long embraced blue tractors—“Blue is in our blood.”  Coastal PASS partners with Raven Industries, PTx Trimble, Ecorobotix and other innovators to bring you AI‑powered weed control, advanced field computers and ultra‑accurate GNSS receivers ￼.  Our technology stack is built around award‑winning hardware and robust software integration.
	•	Local presence, global standards.  We live and work where you farm.  Our offices in Salinas, King City and Paso Robles make it easy to get in‑person support, yet our solutions meet or exceed the most demanding precision‑agriculture standards.  Whether you run a few acres or multiple orchards, we’re invested in your success.

Looking Ahead: GNSS Planning

Just as Coastal Tractor pioneered specialised vineyard equipment ￼, Coastal PASS is pioneering GNSS Planning.  This soon‑to‑launch platform will allow you to check satellite visibility, interference risk and dilution‑of‑precision in advance, ensuring your guidance systems perform optimally during spraying, planting or harvesting.  You’ll be able to save field boundaries, set alerts for periods of poor GNSS coverage and synchronise positioning data with your Raven or PTx Trimble displays.  Built on a resilient backend with provider fail‑over and real‑time interference analytics, GNSS Planning will keep you productive even when the sky is challenging.

Commitment to Service

Being part of Coastal Tractor means we hold ourselves to the same high bar for customer service ￼.  We specialise in vineyard and vegetable equipment ￼, and we combine that specialism with modern ag‑tech to deliver integrated solutions—from hands‑on installations and training to remote diagnostics and software updates.  Farmers on the Central Coast have trusted our family for over half a century; Coastal PASS builds on that trust by providing the tools you’ll need for the next fifty years.
