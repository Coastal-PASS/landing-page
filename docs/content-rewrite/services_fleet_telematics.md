# Fleet Telematics  
### Mixed-fleet visibility without the guesswork

Modern farming depends on knowing where your equipment is, how it’s performing, and what problems are emerging before they cost you a crop. Our telematics solutions connect CNH, Trimble, Raven, and aftermarket systems into one unified dashboard.

We help growers and dealerships monitor:
- Real-time location
- Engine hours and usage patterns
- Diagnostic trouble codes
- Fuel consumption and idle time
- Operator behavior and efficiency
- Preventative maintenance intervals

## Why it matters
Better visibility means fewer surprises.  
Fewer surprises mean fewer breakdowns and more uptime.

## Perfect For
- Mixed-brand fleets  
- Service managers needing standardized diagnostics  
- Growers juggling multiple operators or ranch locations  
- Dealerships offering remote support or monitoring packages  

## Start the conversation
We’ll help you select the right telematics platform for your fleet and integrate it across every machine.
