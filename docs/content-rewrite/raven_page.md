Reach a new level with the Raven Air Blast Sprayer Application Kit

Specialty crop growers gain unmatched control and efficiency by outfitting their air blast sprayers with Raven’s technology.  Real‑time rate control and precision guidance can boost daily coverage by up to 20% and cut crop protection inputs by roughly 10%.  Integrating Raven technology into your existing sprayer enhances accuracy, reduces waste and improves profitability in orchard and vineyard applications.

CR7
The CR7 is a compact 7‑inch field computer built for simplicity and flexibility.  Its customizable widget‑based interface and map‑based navigation make guidance intuitive, while auto field boundary creation and an interactive job list keep operators organised ￼.  Slingshot‑ready connectivity enables file transfer, remote support and over‑the‑air updates ￼, and the plug‑and‑play design lets you move the unit between machines with minimal setup.  The CR7 is ideal for growers who routinely follow the same paths, even on irregular rows and uneven terrain.

Viper 4+
For larger machines or advanced operations, the Viper 4+ offers a 12.1‑inch responsive touchscreen with a tablet‑style interface ￼.  Operators can switch between horizontal and vertical orientation and customise profiles by user and machine ￼.  Four integrated camera inputs help monitor bin levels, blind spots and roadway operation ￼, while an integrated, fully scalable GPS receiver and Ethernet port provide accurate guidance and connectivity ￼.  This display excels in seeding, spraying and spreading applications, connecting producers to a rich ecosystem of analytics for increased operational efficiency.

Connectivity

Field Hub 2.1 brings reliable, high‑speed connectivity to your cab no matter where you are.  The 4G LTE modem works across most mobile networks with 3G fallback ￼, while an Ethernet port and Wi‑Fi hotspot deliver internet access to Raven displays and other devices ￼.  Integrated GPS and serial connections support cellular RTK streaming and enable fleet tracking via Slingshot® portals ￼, linking your operators, managers and Coastal PASS support on one centralised network in real time.
